In this repository you can find the code for the functional ANOVA to find the significant factors impacting the objective and subjective fatigue indicator. We recruited 14 subjects to perform an over-shoulder order-picking task in four different sessions, including four different combinations of task paces and loads (2.5 kg load, and 10 bpm(bottles per minute) pace, 1.5kg and 15 bpm, 2.5 kg and 10 bpm, and 2.5 kg, and 5 bpm).
